# Database-Project
This was a school project where I analyzed a business and how it operated. Then, I created a program to encapsulate its operations. This included creating a database as well as cleaning and uploading the companyâ€™s data into the database. A C# program I wrote was then connected to the database to allow employees and customers to interact with it.
